        <h1>NYC Math State Test Scores</h1>
        <text>Looking at the progression of math state test scores in each district from 2013-2023, with breakdowns of the financial situation of test takers in each district, to understand how financial situation may play a role in education, and to see where the more underserved communities are in NYC.</text>
        <br><br>
        <text>What counts as economically disadvantaged? - A student who participates in, or has a family member that participates in, economic assistance programs (such as reduced-price or free lunch programs, food stamps, foster care, EITC, SSI, TANF, or others) are identified as economically disadvantaged.</text>
        <!--https://data.nysed.gov/glossary.php?report=enrollment#:~:text=Economically%20disadvantaged%20students%20are%20those,Income%20Tax%20Credit%20(EITC)%2C -->
        <br><br>
        <h2>Macro Page Prototype</h2>
        <img src="macro_prototype.jpg" alt="macro prototype"><br>
        <text>I aimed to quickly show the spread of economically disadvantaged students across the city with a color red gradient. People can easily see the darker regions corresponding to more economically disadvantaged students.</text>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Micro Page Prototype</h2>
        <img src="micro_prototype.jpg" alt="macro prototype"><br>
        <text>I aimed to quickly show the difference in amount of economically disadvantaged students and non-economically disadvantaged students that scored a certain test score over time. The line graph shows both progression and amount difference quickly and clearly.</text>
        <br><br>
        <text>What changed in the final design? - In my final macro page, I wanted to also show test scores along with economic situations, like others told me to in their feedback. In my final micro page, I wanted to show on a whole map of NYC where the school district is, like someone said in their feedback. I also want to show the number of students in that district.</text>
