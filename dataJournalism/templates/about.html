        <h1>NYC Math State Test Scores and the Economically Disadvantaged</h1>
        <text>This is an investigation looking at the progression of math state test scores in each district from 
            2013-2023 (excluding 2020 when the State Test wasn't administered, and 2021 when it was optional, both due to 
            the COVID-19 pandemic), with breakdowns of the financial situation of test takers in each district, to 
            understand how financial situation may play a role in education, and to see where the more underserved 
            communities are in NYC.</text>
        <br><br>
        <text>What counts as economically disadvantaged? - A student who participates in, or has a family member that 
            participates in, economic assistance programs (such as reduced-price or free lunch programs, food stamps, 
            foster care, EITC, SSI, TANF, or others) are identified as economically disadvantaged.</text>
        <!--https://data.nysed.gov/glossary.php?report=enrollment#:~:text=Economically%20disadvantaged%20students%20are%20those,Income%20Tax%20Credit%20(EITC)%2C -->
        <br><br>
        <h2>Macro Page Prototype</h2>
        <img src="macro_prototype.jpg" alt="macro prototype"><br>
        <text>I aimed to quickly show the spread of economically disadvantaged students across the city with a color red 
            gradient. People can easily see the darker regions corresponding to more economically disadvantaged students.</text>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Micro Page Prototype</h2>
        <img src="micro_prototype.jpg" alt="macro prototype"><br>
        <text>I aimed to quickly show the difference in amount of economically disadvantaged students and non-economically 
            disadvantaged students that scored a certain test score over time. The line graph shows both progression and 
            amount difference quickly and clearly.</text>
        <br><br>
        <text>What changed in the final design? - In my final macro page, I wanted to also show test scores along with 
            economic situations, like others told me to in their feedback. In my final micro page, I wanted to show on a 
            whole map of NYC where the school district is, like someone said in their feedback. I also want to show the 
            number of students in that district.</text>

            <text>Data Pipeline</text>
            <ol>
                <li>Download data from OpenNYC as CSV file</li>
                <li>Open CSV in Google Sheets, delete all unnecessary rows of data, leaving only data about score breakdown 
                    by financial situation of test-takers in each district from 2013-2023
                </li>
                <li>Export cleansed CSV file, use python to organize that file into a json dictionary</li>
                <li>Json dictionary has 3 nested dictionaries. Outer dictionary has keys of school districts.
                    Each district has keys of categories of "Econ Disadv" and "Not Econ Disadv". Each category has keys of
                    years. Each year has info of number of students in that category that took the test that year, and the
                    percentage of them that scored a 1, 2, 3, or 4.
